Windows error cannot delete because path name is too long: [

    Example: If you have a folder path that's too long such as:
    
    follow these instructions to delete it.

    Create an empty folder, such as C:\Users\Name\Desktop\temp.
    in command prompt type:
    
    robocopy C:\Users\Name\Desktop\temp D:\BackupFolder /purge
    
    Note: If there are spaces in either path in Step 3, the path must be inclosed by quotation marks.  
    Used: In Cmder to clear out node_dependencies worked like a charm ]

Vim editing: 
   arrows for navigation
   insert key to start editing
   esc to stop
   :w  to save
   :q to quit vim

   vim <newfilename> creates a new file and opens for editing

command line:  
   mkdir - creates folder
   rm <filename>  - deletes a file
   
Node and npm :
  to upgrade:  npm update npm -g
  if that does not work on Windows try:  npm install npm@latest -g (worked to bring npm from 2.X.X. to 3.X.X in Win10 OS)
